# Cloud Counselage Student Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes student data from Cloud Counselage events, focusing on key factors such as academic performance, Python programming experience, family income, and expected salary. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights that can aid students in career planning and educational institutions in improving training and placement strategies.

## 🔍 Key Objectives

- Analyze the number of unique students and their participation trends.
- Evaluate GPA distributions across different colleges and cities.
- Assess Python programming experience and its correlation with salary expectations.
- Identify trends in course completion and leadership skills.
- Visualize and interpret patterns in expected salary, family income, and academic performance.

## 📂 Dataset Information

- **File Name:** `Data analyst Data (2).xlsx`
- **Sheet Name:** `All Events Data`
- **Key Columns:**
  - `First Name`, `Email ID`, `College Name`, `Year of Graduation`
  - `CGPA`, `Experience with Python (Months)`, `Family Income`, `Expected Salary (Lac)`
  - `Leadership Skills`, `Courses Completed`, `City`

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Visualization Tools:** Bar charts, Histograms, Boxplots, Scatterplots

## 📊 Data Analysis Steps

1. **Data Cleaning:** Renaming columns, handling missing values, converting data types.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Computing summary statistics and distributions.
3. **Visualization:** Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze trends.
4. **Insights Extraction:** Identifying correlations between GPA, expected salary, Python experience, and leadership skills.

## 📈 Key Findings

- The **average GPA** varies across different colleges and cities.
- Students with **higher Python experience** tend to have higher expected salaries.
- **Leadership skills** impact both **GPA and salary expectations**.
- A clear **trend in graduation years** and student participation was observed.
